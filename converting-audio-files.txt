Converting Audio Files
The sox utility is an extremely versatile tool for working with audio files in different
freely available formats. Here are a few examples of things you can do with sox:
The following command concatenates two WAV files to a single output file:
$ sox head.wav tail.wav output.wav
This command mixes two WAV files:
$ soxmix sound1.wav sound2.wav output.wav
To use sox to display information about a file, use the stat effect as follows:
$ sox sound1.wav -e stat
